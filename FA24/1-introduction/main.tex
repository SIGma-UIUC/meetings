\begin{frame}{Millennium Prize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item On May 24, 2000, The Clay Mathematics Institute put a \$1 million reward on 7 unsolved "Millennium Problems". \pause
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Only one has been solved, but the winner, Grigori Perelman, turned down the prize due to "disagreement with the organized mathematical community."
        \end{itemize} \pause
        \item The question of P vs NP is one of the 6 remaining unsolved problems, and proof that $P = NP$ would have major implications in computing and beyond. \pause
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Cryptography
            \item Problem solving
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Background}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Big-O analysis is used to analyze the runtime of an algorithm without getting bogged down by relatively insignificant details. \pause
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If an algorithm is \emph{$O(n)$}, runtime grows linearly to the size of the input. \pause
            \item For \emph{$O(n!)$} algorithms, runtime grows factorially to the size of the input. \pause
            \item $O(n) = O(\frac{n}{2}) = O(2000 \cdot n + 37) = O(c \cdot n)$ \pause
        \end{itemize}
        \item This type of thinking works because computers operate at scale. \pause
        \item A \emph{polynomial-time} algorithm has a runtime of the form $O(n^k)$ for some $k$. Notably, this excludes exponentials and factorials. \pause
        \item \emph{Deterministic}: a process with a predictable result for a given start state.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{P vs NP}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{P}: the set of \textbf{decision} problems that a \textbf{deterministic} algorithm can solve in polynomial time. \pause
        \item \emph{NP}: the set of \textbf{decision} problems that a \textbf{nondeterministic} algorithm can solve in polynomial time. These problems can be \textbf{verifed} in polynomial time. \pause
        \item The big question: "Are these two types of problems truly different?" \pause
        \item Intuitively (and informally), this asks if problems that can be checked easily can also be solved easily. \pause
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (Intuitively, it feels like the answer should be no...)

    \begin{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item A nondeterministic algorithm is faster: imagine if we could correctly chose the right path at every junction. At that point, are we really solving anything? \pause

        \begin{itemize}
            \item ...so magic algorithms might be possible?! \pause
        \end{itemize}
        \item This particular problem is \emph{NP-complete}, which means every other problem in NP \emph{reduces} to it.

\section{Reductions and the Traveling Salesman}
\frame{\sectionpage}

\begin{frame}{But What Are Reductions?}
    We can show that a problem is in NP if we can use it to solve some other problem that we already know is in NP. This is a proof-by-contradiction of sorts.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Traveling Salesman}
    Consider a salesman trying to visit some collection of cities on business before returning home. We ask: "Is it possible to visit these cities by traveling $\le k$ miles?"
    \\\\\\\\\\
    Is this problem NP-Hard?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Traveling Salesman Reduction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Assume we have a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the TSP. \pause
        \item Now consider an instance of the Hamiltonian Cycle problem with graph $G = (V, E)$. \pause
        \item We want to use our TSP algorithm to find a Hamiltonian cycle. \pause
        \item Construct a new weighted graph, $G' = G$ with weights given by $w(u) = 1$ for $u \in V$. \pause
        \item Now we only have to run the TSP algorithm asking if it is possible to visit all the cities in $\le |V|$ miles. $G$ has a Hamiltonian Cycle if and only if the algorithm returns "yes."
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Traveling Salesman Reduction Cont.}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It took polynomial time to construct $G'$ from $G$, and our imagined TSP algorithm is also polynomial time, so the whole process took polynomial time. \pause
        \item But we believe the Hamiltonian Cycle problem is not solvable in polynomial time—a contradiction. \pause
        \item Thus, our initial assumption that a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the TSP exists is wrong, and the TSP is NP-hard.

\begin{frame}{Weekly Brainteaser}
    After the revolution, each of the 66 citizens of a certain city, including the king, has a salary of 1. King cannot vote, but has the power to suggest changes to the distribution of salaries. Each person's salary must be a \textbf{non-negative whole number of dollars}, and the salaries must sum to 66. He suggests a new salary plan for every person including himself in front of the city. Citizens are greedy, and vote yes if their salary is raised, no if decreased, and don't vote otherwise. The majority vote wins. The king proposes a series of plans to maximize his salary. \textbf{What is the king's maximum salary?}
