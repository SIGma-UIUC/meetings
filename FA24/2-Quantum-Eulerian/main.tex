        \item \emph{Eulerian Circuit Problem}: Determine if a graph $G$ has an Eulerian circuit (and is thus Eulerian). \pause
        \item Unlike the Hamiltonian cycle problem from last week, this is very much NOT NP-hard.
        \item As it turns out, even classically, we can do this in $O(n^2)$ time in the adjacency matrix model and $O(n)$ time in the adjacency list model.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Euler's Theorem (The Graph Theory One (The Eulerian Circuits One))}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A (connected undirected) graph has an Eulerian circuit if and only if every vertex has even degree.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Euler's Theorem Proof}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Assume that we have a graph $G = (V, E)$ with $|V| = n$ and $|E| = m$.  \pause
        \item Assume $G$ has an Eulerian circuit $v_1 \to v_2 \to \dots \to v_m \to v_1$, where the vertices may repeat but the edges may not. \pause
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The total amount of vertices (repeats included) in the circuit must be equal to the total amount of edges in the graph. \pause
            \item The degree of a vertex is equal to the number of edges connected to it. \pause
            \item We can go through the circuit and increment the degree of a vertex each time we encounter an edge that uses that vertex. \pause
            \item Each time we encounter a vertex, we encounter exactly 2 adjacent edges, which must all be unique since this is an Eulerian circuit. \pause
            \item So, each vertex in $G$ has even degree.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Euler's Theorem Proof}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Assume that we have a graph $G = (V, E)$ with $|V| = n$ and $|E| = m$. \pause
        \item Assume all vertices of $G$ have even degree. \pause
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Induct on the number of vertices $n$. \pause
            \item Base Case: A graph with 1 vertex and thus 0 edges vacuously has an Eulerian circuit. \pause
            \item Assume that every graph with $k < n$ vertices all with even degree has an Eulerian circuit.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Euler's Theorem Proof}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Assume all vertices of $G$ have even degree.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Now, we have $n$ vertices. \pause
            \item Choose some vertex $v_0$ and remove it and its adjacent edges to create a new graph $G'$. \pause
            \item We must have removed an even amount $2x$ of edges to an even amount of other vertices $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_{2x - 1}, v_{2x}$. \pause
            \item Split these other vertices into $x$ pairs $(v_{2i - 1}, v_{2i})$. \pause
            \item For each pair, if they were already connected with an edge, remove that edge, otherwise, add that edge. \pause
            \item Now, each of the affected vertices in $G'$ has either lost one edge and gained one edge or lost two edges, maintaining the even degree property.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Euler's Theorem Proof}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Assume all vertices of $G$ have even degree.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $G'$ is now composed of some number of connected components, each containing only vertices of even degree.
            \item By the inductive hypothesis, each of these connected components has an Eulerian circuit. \pause
            \item Consider the pairs of vertices $(v_{2i - 1}, v_{2i})$ we connected. \pause
            \item If we remove the edge and add $v_0$ and its adjacent edges again, we can go from $v_{2i - 1}$ to $v_0$ to $v_{2i}$ instead. \pause
            \item Consider the pairs of vertices $(v_{2j - 1}, v_{2j})$ we disconnected. \pause
            \item If we readd the edge and add $v_0$ and its adjacent edges again, we can go from (the Eulerian circuit of the CC $v_{2j - 1}$ was a part of) to $v_{2j - 1}$ to $v_0$ to $v_{2j}$ to (the Eulerian circuit of the CC $v_{2j}$ was a part of if different) to $v_{2j - 1}$, reconstructing an Eulerian circuit in $G$.

\begin{frame}{Note About Quantum Algorithms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item You don't have to know many details of quantum computing to understand most quantum algorithms. \pause
    \item Most quantum algorithms for graph theory problems do most of the work by calling the same few critical quantum algorithms. \pause
    \item If you know what those smaller quantum algorithms do, you can blackbox them away.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Notions of Complexity}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \emph{quantum query complexity} of a graph algorithm is the number of queries it makes to the adjacency matrix or list representing the graph. \pause
    \item The \emph{quantum time complexity} of a graph algorithm is the number basic quantum operations it makes.

\begin{frame}{Grover's Algorithm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Quantum Search Problem: Suppose we have a function $f: \{0, 1, \dots, n - 1\} \to \{0, 1\}$ such that $f(x) = 1$ for at most one $x$, which we will call $\omega$. Find this $x$ if it exists. \pause
    \item Grover's algorithm can do this using $O(\sqrt{n})$ evaluations of $f$, beating the classical $O(n)$ evaluations. \pause

\begin{frame}{Reducing Error}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Quantum algorithms are not always correct. \pause
    \item They output an incorrect answer with a probability $p$. \pause
    \item To get the probability of an incorrect answer down to $\epsilon$, we need to repeat $r$ times so that $p^r \leq \epsilon$, so we can make the probability of an incorrect answer less than $\frac{1}{n}$ by repeating each quantum subroutine $r = O(\log n)$ times \pause
    \item So, if we have a quantum algorithm with $O(f(n))$ quantum query complexity, it will typically have $O(f(n) \log n)$ quantum time complexity. \pause
    \item Grover's algorithm actually needs an extra logarithmic factor, so it will have $O(\sqrt{n} \log^2 n)$ quantum time complexity.
