\begin{block}{Who are we?}
We are the SIG for Math and Algorithms. Our goal is to be a community who like learning about the more theoretical side of computer science.

\textbf{Everyone} is welcome, regardless of what classes they have taken or what background they have. Anyone can learn this stuff and \textit{enjoy} learning it.
